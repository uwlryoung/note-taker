  ## Challenges and Future Improvements 
  - Add the function where users can edit an already saved note rather than having to delete it and start over. 
  - Add a function that allows users to select a category for the note which generates a button (if it's a new category). They can then switch between categories of notes.
  - Add a "Delete All" button if you want to start over completely.
  - Add a "Deadline" query that gives and displays the deadline with the saved notes. If left blank, it won't appear.
